# Image Description App

This is a simple web application where a user can upload an image, and the app will show a text description of the image. The app uses a pre-trained image classification model (MobileNetV2) from TensorFlow to analyze the image and generate a description. I built this project using Flask for the backend and JavaScript for the frontend.

## How I Made This



- **Flask**: Flask is a lightweight Python web framework. I chose it because it is easy to use and set up for small projects like this one.
- **TensorFlow**: TensorFlow is a popular machine learning framework. I used a pre-trained model (MobileNetV2) from TensorFlow to process the images and generate descriptions. MobileNetV2 is efficient and works well for image classification tasks.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: For the frontend, I used basic HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript to handle the image upload and display the description dynamically without reloading the page.

### Why I Used These Technologies

1. **Flask**: I used Flask because it's simple and lightweight. It allows me to focus on the functionality rather than managing complex configurations, making it ideal for quick web app development.
2. **TensorFlow**: TensorFlow’s pre-trained models are very accurate and easy to use. MobileNetV2 was selected because it’s small, fast, and works well with mobile and web applications, which is great for this assignment.
3. **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Since the app is simple and doesn't need advanced frontend functionality, I decided to stick with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This makes the app easy to understand and use.

## Features

- Users can upload an image.
- The app shows a text description of the image generated by the TensorFlow model.
- The interface is simple and easy to use.

## How I Deployed It

I didn’t deploy this project on any cloud platform since the assignment only requires the app to run locally. However, I made sure the app works perfectly on my local machine by following these steps:

1. Set up the environment using Python and install the required libraries (Flask, TensorFlow, Pillow).
2. Used Flask to create a simple backend server that handles image upload and image processing.
3. Used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make the frontend user-friendly and interactive.
4. The app runs locally on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## Requirements

Before running this project on your machine, you need to have the following:

- **Python 3.x**
- **Flask** (for web framework)
- **TensorFlow** (for image classification)
- **Pillow** (for image processing)
